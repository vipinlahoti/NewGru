### Welcome to Grudr!

If you're reading this, it means you've successfully got Grudr to run. 

To make your first run a bit easier, we've taken the liberty of preloading your brand new app with a few articles that will walk you through your first steps with Grudr.

### 1. Creating An Account

The first thing you'll need to do is create your account. Since this will be the first ever account created in this app, it will automatically be assigned admin rights, and you'll then be able to access Grudr's settings panel.

Click the “Register” link in the top menu and come back here once you're done!

### 2. Configuring Settings

The next step is configuring a few basic settings, such as your site's title, logo, or language. Don't worry, you can change all of these at any time!

To do so, go to the “Admin” menu and click on “Settings”.

### 3. Start Articleing!

You're now all set to start using Grudr. Check out the other articles for more information, or just start articleing!
